# MYLES' ONBOARDING PROJECT

## Description:
A basic website. More specifically...

>  A generic user management system that utilizes a backend to view and edit an arbitrary list of users.

The list of users will be updated and modified based on the addition, modification, and deletion of individual user profiles.


## How to Use
 To start the server, use terminal to navigate to the source of the project directory (where gulpfile.js is) and enter the default gulp command:

 >$ gulp

*(for more info on commands, enter 'gulp help')*

The server should start on **localhost:1820** by default.

Currently, the website is hardcoded with place-holder information and most of the features **do not** work. To view the webpage, go to [http://localhost:1820/src/](http://localhost:1820/src/) while the server is running.

To stop the server, hit *[ctrl]+[c]* in the terminal.
